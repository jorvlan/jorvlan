- 👋 Hi, I’m @jorvlan / Jordy van Langen
- 👀 I’m interested in best open-source/open-science practices by (1) creating, (2) sharing and (3) helping others with code and data visualizations while also doing scientific research as my main job [@Donders](https://www.ru.nl/donders/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Building New Graphical Elements with R
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating version 2.0 of our raincloudplots R-package and educating the wider academic community on data visualizations
