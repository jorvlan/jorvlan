- 👋 Hi, I’m [@jorvlan](https://www.github.com/jorvlan) / Jordy van Langen
- 👀 I’m interested in best open-source/open-science practices by (1) creating, (2) sharing and (3) helping others with code and data visualizations while also doing scientific research as my main job [@Donders](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) & [@lcd-lab](https://www.rogierkievit.com/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Building New Graphical Elements with R
- 💞️ I’m currently co-developing our *2nd* raincloudplots R-package [`ggrain`](https://github.com/njudd/ggrain), developing a new 'raincloudplots' Shiny App, and educating the wider academic community on data visualizations through our [Virtual workshops](https://www.github.com/jorvlan/raincloudplots-workshops)
