- 👋 Hi, I’m [@jorvlan](https://www.github.com/jorvlan) / Jordy van Langen
- 👀 I’m interested in best open-source/open-science practices through (1) creating, (2) sharing and (3) helping others with code and data visualizations. I am also doing scientific research as my main job [@Donders](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) & [@lcd-lab](https://www.rogierkievit.com/) as part of the [NWO Open Science Fund](https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/203001011)
- :koala: I am a former visiting junior researcher at the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Australia. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Building New Graphical Elements with R
- 💞️ I’m currently co-developing our *2nd* [`raincloudplots`](https://github.com/jorvlan/raincloudplots) R-package [`ggrain`](https://github.com/njudd/ggrain) which we are implementing in the free open-source [JASP Statistics](https://jasp-stats.org), developing a new 'raincloudplots' Shiny App,  and educating the wider academic community on data visualizations through our [Virtual workshops](https://www.github.com/jorvlan/raincloudplots-workshops), all funded by our awarded [NWO Open Science Fund](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/26-projects-stimulate-open-science)
